With one of the numbers at the top selected, click on a cell in the 9 x 9 grid to enter a number there.

Press Solve to apply the algorithm.

If the puzzle is solvable it will (always) solve it.

If there is more than one solution it will find one of them.

I am not sure what it will do with an unsolvable puzzle (it probably won't solve it).

Use the slider at the bottom to change how fast it goes. At its fastest it should solve any solvable puzzle in less than a second. Slow it down to see what it is doing.

Put the file sudoku.java in some folder, type javac sudoku.java to compile it and java sodoku to run it.

When you compile it it will make a load of files. Ignore these. If they look too messy you can delete all except the file sudoku.java.
