java-sudoku
===========

A recursive brute force sudoku solver

compile with "javac sudoku.java"
run with     "java sudoku"

or just ./sudoku.jar

With one of the numbers at the top selected, click on a cell in the 9 x 9 grid to enter a number there.

Press Solve to apply the algorithm.

If the puzzle is solvable it will (always) solve it.

If there is more than one solution it will find one of them.

I am not sure what it will do with an unsolvable puzzle (it probably won't solve it).

Use the slider at the bottom to change how fast it goes. At its fastest it should solve any solvable puzzle in less than a second. Slow it down to see what it is doing.


		**You are free to do what you like with it that won't get either of us in trouble**
**If it does anything wrong it isn't my fault (you are the one who ran something designed by a drunk student after midnight)**
